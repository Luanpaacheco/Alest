# VLTree and Binary Search Trees (BST)

## Introduction

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of AVL Trees and Binary Search Trees (BST) in Java. These data structures are fundamental in various computer science applications. A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree structure where each node has at most two children and adheres to the property of left child < parent < right child. An AVL Tree is a self-balancing BST that maintains a balance factor, ensuring O(log n) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations.

## Features

### Binary Search Tree (BST)
- **Insertion**: Efficiently add new nodes to the tree.
- **Deletion**: Remove nodes while maintaining the BST properties.
- **Search**: Quickly find elements in the tree.
- **Traversals**:
  - In-order
  - Pre-order
  - Post-order

### AVL Tree
- **Insertion**: Adds nodes with self-balancing to maintain tree height.
- **Deletion**: Removes nodes with self-balancing to ensure efficiency.
- **Search**: Quickly find elements in the self-balancing structure.
- **Traversals**:
  - In-order
  - Pre-order
  - Post-order
